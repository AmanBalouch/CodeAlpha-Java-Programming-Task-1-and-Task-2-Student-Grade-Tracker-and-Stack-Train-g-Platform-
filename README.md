Step 1: Execute stackTradingPlatform.sql in MySQL Workbench
Open MySQL Workbench:
Launch MySQL Workbench on your Mac.
Connect to Your MySQL Server:
Click on your MySQL connection and log in with your credentials.
Open the stackTradingPlatform.sql Script:
Go to the top menu and click on File > Open SQL Script....
Browse to the location of the stackTradingPlatform.sql file, select it, and click Open.
Execute the SQL Script:
The script will open in a new SQL tab.
To execute the script line by line, you can either:
Highlight the lines you want to execute and click the Execute button (lightning bolt icon), or
Press Cmd + Shift + Enter after selecting the lines.
Continue executing each section of the script until all commands have been run.
Verify Database Creation:
After executing the script, refresh the Schemas panel in MySQL Workbench to verify that the stackTradingPlatform database and its tables have been created successfully.
Step 2: Connect stackTradingPlatform.java to the MySQL Database
Open stackTradingPlatform.java:
Open your Java project in your development environment (e.g., Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
Set Up Database Connection Parameters:
In the stackTradingPlatform.java file, configure the database connection parameters. Ensure that you provide the correct URL, username, and password.
Here is an example of how you should configure the connection:

java
Copy code
import java.sql.Connection;
import java.sql.DriverManager;
import java.sql.SQLException;

public class stackTradingPlatform {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/stackTradingPlatform"; // URL to your MySQL database
        String username = "your_username"; // Replace with your MySQL username
        String password = "your_password"; // Replace with your MySQL password

        try {
            Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url, username, password);
            System.out.println("Connected to the database successfully!");
            
            // Your application logic here

        } catch (SQLException e) {
            System.out.println("Failed to connect to the database.");
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
Replace "your_username" and "your_password" with your actual MySQL credentials.
Compile and Run stackTradingPlatform.java:
Compile and run the stackTradingPlatform.java file within your development environment.
Ensure that the application successfully connects to the MySQL database. You should see a confirmation message if the connection is successful.
Verify Functionality:
Once the connection is established, proceed with the execution of the application to ensure that it interacts with the database as expected.
